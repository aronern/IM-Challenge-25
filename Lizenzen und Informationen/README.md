# Joint Order Selection, Allocation, Batching and Picking 

This project contains accompanying code for Zalando Team BART's (Batching Algorithms) publication [Joint Order Selection, Allocation, Batching and Picking for Large Scale Warehouses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04563).
The instances used to create results in the paper are stored in `instances.zip`.

## How to use

1. Clone this project and copy the files into your own project
2. Generate batching instances via `python generate_instances.py` (any Python 3.6+ works). For each generated instance (per default in the `instances` folder) four files will be created: `{articles, orders, parameters, warehouse_items}.json`. 
3. Run the Distance Greedy Algorithm (DGA) via `python solve_instances.py`. Two files will be stored in the respective instance folders: `batches.json` and `statistics.json`.
4. Run the Randomized DGA via `python solve_instances.py -a rdga`
5. Write your own solver to outperform these baseline algorithms :)
